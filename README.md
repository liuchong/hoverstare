HoverStare is an AI code review bot for GitHub pull requests, written in Rust and
shipped as a single static binary that runs as a GitHub Action. Instead of
tossing a diff at a model in one shot, its reviewer **reads your repository
like a human reviewer would** — opening context files, grepping call sites,
comparing against the base branch — before it says anything. A multi-pass
vote plus an independent verifier keeps false positives down, and every
finding it reports is tracked across commits until it's fixed.

## Why HoverStare?

- 🔍 **Repo-aware, not diff-only.** The reviewing model gets a read-only tool
  set (`read_file` / `grep` / `glob` / `show_base_file`) and uses it to verify
  suspicions before reporting. It catches bugs that hide *outside* the diff —
  like a changed function whose callers break two files away.
- 🗳️ **Multi-pass voting + verifier.** Three independent review passes
  (correctness / concurrency / security lenses) vote on findings; lone-vote
  findings must survive an independent verifier pass with tool access.
  High signal, low noise.
- 📌 **Precise inline comments.** Line numbers are validated against the real
  diff and snapped to the nearest valid anchor, so comments land exactly where
  the bug is — never on the wrong line.
- 🔁 **Incremental reviews.** Push a fix and HoverStare reviews only the delta,
  marks fixed findings as resolved (or leaves a "✅ confirmed fixed" note),
  and never repeats itself.
- 🛡️ **Fail-open by design.** Network trouble, rate limits, or a flaky model
  will never block your CI.
- 🔑 **BYOK.** Bring your own key: Anthropic, or any OpenAI-compatible endpoint
  (Kimi, DeepSeek, OpenRouter, …). Code goes straight to your provider.

## How it works

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    A[PR opened / synchronized] --> B{skip?}
    B -->|draft / bot / empty diff| Z((exit 0))
    B --> C[fetch diff]
    C --> D{prior review?}
    D -->|yes| E[delta diff]
    D -->|no| F[full diff]
    E --> G
    F --> G["N parallel review passes<br/>(read-only repo tools)"]
    G --> H[cluster & vote]
    H --> I[verifier pass]
    I --> J[validate & anchor lines]
    J --> K["post review<br/>+ resolve fixed threads<br/>+ status checks"]
```

Every inline comment carries a hidden fingerprint (`path + code line + title`
hash). On the next push, HoverStare diffs against its previous review, asks the
model which open findings are fixed, and resolves those threads — immune to
line-number drift.

## Quick start (2 minutes)

**1. Add the workflow** — `.github/workflows/hoverstare.yml`:

```yaml
name: HoverStare
on:
  pull_request:
    types: [opened, reopened, synchronize]
  issue_comment:
    types: [created]
  pull_request_review_comment:
    types: [created]

permissions:
  contents: read
  pull-requests: write
  statuses: write

concurrency:
  # 不含 @hoverstare 的评论事件给独立组名，避免无意义的 run 取消正在跑的审查
  group: >-
    hoverstare-${{
      (github.event_name == 'issue_comment' || github.event_name == 'pull_request_review_comment')
      && !contains(github.event.comment.body, '@hoverstare')
      && format('noop-{0}', github.event.comment.id)
      || (github.event.pull_request.number || github.event.issue.number)
    }}
  cancel-in-progress: true

jobs:
  hoverstare:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
        with:
          fetch-depth: 0
      - uses: liuchong/hoverstare@v0.0.5
        env:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          OPENAI_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.HOVERSTARE_LLM_KEY }}
          OPENAI_BASE_URL: ${{ vars.HOVERSTARE_LLM_BASE_URL }}
          HOVERSTARE_MODEL: ${{ vars.HOVERSTARE_MODEL }}   # e.g. kimi-for-coding
```

**2. Configure LLM credentials** (pick one):

| Provider | Settings |
|---|---|
| **Anthropic** | secret `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` (default model `claude-sonnet-4-6`) |
| **OpenAI-compatible** (Kimi, DeepSeek, OpenRouter…) | secret `OPENAI_API_KEY`, var `OPENAI_BASE_URL` (e.g. `https://api.kimi.com/coding/v1`), and a model name via var `HOVERSTARE_MODEL` or `model` in `.github/hoverstare.toml` |

> ⚠️ With an OpenAI-compatible endpoint you **must** set the model name —
> the default `claude-sonnet-4-6` won't exist there.

**3. (Optional) Repo config** — `.github/hoverstare.toml`, every field optional:

```toml
model = "kimi-for-coding"             # main review model
reformat_model = "kimi-for-coding-highspeed"  # cheap model for output repair
passes = 3                            # parallel review passes; 1 disables voting
verify = true                         # verifier pass for single-vote findings
severity_threshold = "medium"         # below this → Nitpicks section only
ignore = ["*.lock", "**/dist/**", "**/*.min.js"]
max_diff_kb = 400                     # diff budget (truncated by priority)
max_tool_calls = 20                   # agentic loop tool budget
timeout_secs = 900
review_drafts = false
fail_closed = false                   # true → analysis failures fail CI
status_checks = false                 # write hoverstare / hoverstare-findings checks
language = "en"                       # output language: en/zh-CN/ru/fr/de/es
set_temperature = true                # false for endpoints that only accept default temperature
instructions = ""                     # team-specific review focus, injected into the system prompt
```

## Repository instructions

HoverStare reads repo-level rule files and applies them to reviews (they
supplement but never override the built-in core rules). Precedence:

1. `hoverstare.md` / `.hoverstare.md` / `.hoverstare/*.md` / `.github/hoverstare.md`
2. `AGENTS.md`
3. `.github/copilot-instructions.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `.cursorrules`

Files are read **from the base branch** (a PR editing AGENTS.md cannot inject
instructions). Core safety rules (read-only tools, targeted verification,
defect-only scope, JSON contract) can never be overridden.

## Optional: brand identity (posts as your own bot)

By default, reviews post as `github-actions[bot]` — that's a `GITHUB_TOKEN`
limitation, and **it's the recommended mode for most users** (zero extra setup).

Want a branded bot identity? Register **your own** GitHub App (5 minutes, no
server needed — token exchange happens inside GitHub Actions) and pass its
credentials to the action:

1. Create a GitHub App at *Settings → Developer settings → GitHub Apps*
   (webhook **off**; permissions: contents read, pull-requests write,
   issues write, commit statuses write), install it on your repo
2. Add its App ID and private key as secrets `APP_ID` / `APP_PRIVATE_KEY`
3. Pass them:

```yaml
      - uses: liuchong/hoverstare@v0.0.5
        with:
          app_id: ${{ secrets.APP_ID }}
          app_private_key: ${{ secrets.APP_PRIVATE_KEY }}
```

Reviews then post as **your-app-name[bot]**, and `resolveReviewThread` works
without the `GITHUB_TOKEN` limitation (no `GH_PAT` needed).

> **Zero-config `hoverstare[bot]` identity** for everyone is on the roadmap as
> an optional self-hostable `hoverstare serve` webhook service.

## `@hoverstare` commands

Post in a PR (repo collaborators only):

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `@hoverstare review` | Force a full re-review |
| `@hoverstare explain` | Reply in the thread with a plain-language explanation of the finding |
| `@hoverstare help` | Command list |

## Develop mode: issues & PRs as your AI IDE

HoverStare can also *develop* — issues and PRs become a conversation-driven
development environment (spec 11):

**Issue mainline** — file an issue mentioning `@hoverstare`:

1. It investigates the repo and replies with an analysis + plan (in comments).
2. Discuss by simply replying; each round is answered in the thread.
3. `@hoverstare go` — it creates a branch, implements, pushes, and opens a PR
   (with `Closes #N`).

**PR mainline** — on any same-repo PR:

- `@hoverstare <instruction>` — it checks out the PR branch, develops, commits
  (Conventional Commits, authored as `hoverstare[bot]`), pushes back to the
  branch, and reports in a comment. Rounds that exhaust their budget
  self-continue (max 10 rounds per PR).
- `@hoverstare merge` — once checks are green and there are no conflicts, it
  squash-merges and deletes the source branch.

Setup: add the `issues` and `pull_request_review` triggers and grant
`contents: write` + `issues: write`. See `.github/workflows/hoverstare.yml`
for a complete working example. Notes:

- Only repo collaborators can issue commands; fork PRs are out of scope.
- For pushes, pass a PAT via the `gh_pat` input or use a GitHub App token with
  `contents: write` — pushes made with the default `GITHUB_TOKEN` do **not**
  trigger CI, so required checks would never run on bot commits.

## FAQ

**Reviews/comments fail with permission errors?**
Check workflow `permissions` (`pull-requests: write` required) and repo
*Settings → Actions → General → Workflow permissions* is "Read and write".

**"model not found"?**
You configured an OpenAI-compatible endpoint but no model name. Set
`HOVERSTARE_MODEL` (or `model` in `hoverstare.toml`).

**400 / invalid temperature?**
Your endpoint only accepts the default temperature. Set
`set_temperature = false` in `hoverstare.toml`.

**Fixed findings aren't getting resolved?**
A GitHub platform limitation: the default `GITHUB_TOKEN` cannot call
`resolveReviewThread`. HoverStare falls back to a "✅ confirmed fixed" reply in
the thread. For full resolution, store a classic PAT (`repo` scope) as secret
`GH_PAT` and pass it in the workflow env.

**GitHub Enterprise?**
Set `GITHUB_API_URL=https://<your-ghe-host>/api/v3`.

## Local development

```bash
# Dry-run a full review of a public PR (no publishing)
export OPENAI_API_KEY=... OPENAI_BASE_URL=... HOVERSTARE_MODEL=...
cargo run -- review --repo owner/repo --pr 123 --dry-run

# Review a local diff file (prints tool-call trace)
cargo run --example local_review -- path/to.diff [base_ref]

cargo test                                   # unit + httpmock contract tests
cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings
cargo fmt
```
